# Intro
This list is for anyone seeking to learn more about coercive and controlling behavior. I include write ups of books I've read, how I see them being useful, and what limitations they might have. If you're in or adjacent to a situation with this sort of behavior, I wish you a lot of strength and good community. The more you own and ground yourself in your experiences and feelings, the more of your power and strength you will find. If you struggle with taking accountability and seeking control over others, find professionals, groups and commmunities who hold you accountable, and require that you set these behaviors down. It is better on the other side.


## Emma Rose Byham: Was It Even Abuse

This book is a very solid primer. Written in a generally situation and gender neutral fashion, it's a great place to start, particularly if you are not a woman in a romantic relationship with an abusive man (it's also great for this unfortunately common case). It's a bit less polished than some of the other books, but it makes up for that with solid models of behavior, and clear, extensive definitions of various behaviors. I read this book after most of the others, and I got a ton out of it.Â 

  

## Steven Hassan: Combatting Cult Mind Control

This book was amazing. Written by someone who was in the Moonies cult (aka Unification Church, a Christian, pro-capitalism Korea based cult affiliated with the KCIA), he's since had extensive experience and education in the realm of high control groups and counseling people out. In the book, he says the smallest unit of cult is a cult of two. While much of the content is about larger groups, many of the patterns, tactics and experiences are relevant for interpersonal relationships as well. I really liked that the thesis of the book was that the only way out is to hand people back agency and control over their own lives, and support people in making the right choices for themselves, free of coercion. The book makes it very clear that a cult is not about beliefs, identity, etc, but about behavior and actions. This book changed a lot of my opinions about who are in cults- the ideal target is a healthy, financially stable or even well off, capable person who can be repurposed for free labor and financial exploitation within the cult. The large majority of people who join cults are going through a stressful personal experience (divorce/breakup, death, moving, new job, health diagnosis, etc). This book gives a model and resources for people who are or were in high control relationships and groups, for people who want to protect themselves, and for people who want to support loved ones in getting out.

  

## Lundy Bancroft: Why Does He Do That

This is one of my go to's, for good reason. The myths, the archetypes, and the section at the end about supporting loved ones and community members in abusive relationships, are invaluable. If you read this book, and you think to yourself, "well this person has some of these behaviors, but that's not who they are", know that 1) you are the expert on your situation 2) if you're recognizing these kinds of behaviors, that is worth listening to. This book is also very helpful for people who are watching their loved ones be mistreated. The best thing you can do is be the opposite of the person mistreating them- affirm their feelings and experiences, respect their choices, and state consistently your support and care for them. This book gave me a good base model for stating my personal feelings and boundaries- "I feel upset/sad/angry when I see this person doing X to you, because I think you deserve Y and Z" or "I get really upset and overwhelmed when you tell me how this person isn't treating you well. If you need help taking space from them or making a plan, I am here for you, but I don't want to hear about how they are treating you poorly over and over again, because I get so angry and upset." Owning your own feelings and boundaries, without trying to control theirs, is a gift to anyone struggling with someone else's controlling behavior.
He includes an extensive list of resources and his commentary on them at the end of the book, which is useful all on its own.

  

## Patricia Evans: The Verbally Abusive Relationship

This book was a fantastic resource for understanding and categorizing types of verbal abuse and how these tools function to erode and abuse victims. The list of behaviors were illuminating- some don't resonate, and others can hit very very hard. If you're finding a lot of experiences coming back in reading this, taking notes as you go can be invaluable. It has an interesting model of "Realities", which is a little silly sounding but is one of the main things I've kept from this book. In one reality, there is Power Over other people, because in denying one's only feelings and agency, one seeks to control other people. In the other, there is Personal Power, which comes from owning your own reality and cultivating healthy self-esteem to repel abusive behavior. It's pretty 80s-90s energy at times, and very heteronormative, "women abused by their husbands or boyfriends". It is worth a read regardless, but if that's not exactly your situation, be prepared to do some personal translation and analysis to figure out what applies.

  

## Esther Perel: The State of Affairs

This book was useful for giving a more nuanced idea of infidelity, and what it looks like to rebuild trust and a relationship (or not). This book is only really relevant if the party that committed the trust violation is willing to take accountability and ownership. Regardless of whether that's your situation, it's interesting to know what it can look like when someone does take accountability, but you cannot force or talk someone else into doing so. In situations where someone cheats as a way of coping with an abusive relationship, this can be helpful context. She includes examples of cheating within open relationships, and busts a number of common excuses around men taking mistresses. Many of the suggestions and examples don't really apply in situations of abuse, covert or overt, which Esther Perel is decent at pointing out. This book is more helpful to figure out if you have an infidelity problem, an abuse problem, or some other issue.
