## to be easily extracted

#### Matt Ruff: Sewer Gas and Electric
	The weirdest book ever. So strange on a total level and on a paragraph level

#### Pia Mellody: Facing Codependency
	Top researcher and writer on codependency, her work is *awesome* and accessible

#### Marshall Rosenberg: Non-Violent Communication
	Fantastic communication tool, written by an American psychologist and mediator “a process for supporting partnership and resolving conflict within people, in relationships, and in society”
