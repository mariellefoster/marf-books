## to be easily extracted

#### Matt Ruff: Sewer Gas and Electric
	The weirdest book ever. So strange on a total level and on a paragraph level

#### Pia Mellody: Facing Codependency
	Top researcher and writer on codependency, her work is *awesome* and accessible

#### Marshall Rosenberg: Non-Violent Communication
	Fantastic communication tool, written by an American psychologist and mediator “a process for supporting partnership and resolving conflict within people, in relationships, and in society” 

#### Sarah Pinsker: And Then There Were (N-One)
	Novella about a murder mystery thriller where a character goes to a conference of selves from different timelines. https://uncannymagazine.com/article/and-then-there-were-n-one/ 

#### Becky Chambers: Record of a Spaceborn Few
	Third book in the same world as “Long Way…”, can be read stand alone. So lovely, wonderful, human, and for me got at the questions of who am I in the universe and where do we go now that we’re here?

#### Murderbot Diaries
	Great set of novellas about a grumpy humanoid security bot who just wants to be left alone and watch television
