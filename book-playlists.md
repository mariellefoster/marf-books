## Buoyant and Hilarious
- Martha Wells: All Systems Red
  - Angsty android just wants to watch tv and not be asked about its feelings. We all know one.
- Graeme Simieson: The Rosie Project
- Patrick Weekes: The Palace Job
  - The plots are fine, characters are fun, but the dialogue deserves a Nobel prize
  - Also recommend the sequels The Prophecy Con and The Paladin Caper
- Becky Chambers: The Long Way to A Small, Angry Planet
  - My most recommended book of 2017. Like the best parts of sci fi and tumblr had a beautiful baby
- Matt Ruff: Bad Monkeys
- Naomi Kritzer: Cat Pictures Please and Other Stories
  - Not every story fits this category, but I highly recommend "Bits" and "Cat Pictures Please"
- David J. Schwartz: Gooseberry Bluff Community College
  - pretty fun magical mystery
- Sy Montgomery: The Soul of An Octopus
  - Every chapter is named after an octopus she makes friends with
- Connie Willis: To Say Nothing of the Dog, Or, How We Found the Bishop's Bird Stump at Last
- Casey McQuiston: Red White and Royal Blue
- Sarah Hogle: You Deserve Each Other

## Chewy Soulstuff
- Matt Ruff: Set This House in Order
  - earns the subtitle: a romance of souls, won the Tiptree for best novel exploring gender. I think about this book every day.
- Nnedi Okorafor: Binti
  - I particularly recommend the second novella, Binti: Home, for its fantastic portrayal of PTSD, and cultural/individual identity.
- Lois McMaster Bujold: Mirror Dance
  - My favorite book in the Vorkosigan saga. Not necessarily one I would start with, but it's amazing.
  - Heavy TW for sexual assault, torture.
- Robert Alter: The Book of Job
  - My favorite biblical translator (don't give me that look), his footnotes are unbelievable. The Book of Job is the ancient rap battle about capricious divine retribution, which uses a breathtaking vocabulary that defies modern translation. Alter does a good job.
- Ted Chiang: Stories of your Life and other works
  - Ted Chiang is a recursive mind dissolver. Consume in appropriate quantities.
- Octavia Butler: Bloodchild, and other stories
  - Her stories are a masterclass
- Jewelle Gomez: The Gilda Stories
  - black lesbian vampire novel, one of the best answers I've ever seen to "how does one face the possibility of living forever?"
- Lois McMaster Bujold: Paladin of Souls
  - Curse of Chalion also good, but this for me was a riveting adventure starring a late middle aged woman. How do you live your life when your children are dead or out of the house, everyone has thought you mad for the last 20 years, and people want you to be docile and out of the way?
- N. K. Jemisin: The Fifth Season
  - I *loved* this book. Geologic superpowers, incisive and crafted exploration of oppression and social construction of identity, end times.
  - Also recommend The Stone Sky, and Obelisk Gate
- Seanan McGuire: Down Among the Sticks and Bones
- Naomi Alderman: The Power
  - This book made me think carefully about my perception and experience of gender. Violent, apocalyptic, it gets the tension and overthrow of a global overclass bang on.
- Nick Bantock: The Museum at Purgatory
- Catherynne Valente: The Refrigerator Monologues
- Katherine Addison: The Goblin Emperor
- Octavia Butler: Fledgling
