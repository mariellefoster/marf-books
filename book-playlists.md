# Book Playlists:
This is like a case of homemade CDs a once upon a time generation would burn for their friends. I burned these books together for you.

## Buoyant and Hilarious
- Martha Wells: All Systems Red
  - Angsty android just wants to watch tv and not be asked about its feelings. We all know one.
- Graeme Simieson: The Rosie Project
- Patrick Weekes: The Palace Job
  - The plots are fine, characters are fun, but the dialogue deserves a Nobel prize
- Patrick Weekes: The Prophecy Con
- Patrick Weekes: The Paladin Caper
- Becky Chambers: The Long Way to A Small, Angry Planet
  - My most recommended book of 2017. Like the best parts of sci fi and tumblr had a beautiful baby
- Matt Ruff: Bad Monkeys
- Naomi Kritzer: Cat Pictures Please and Other Stories
  - Not every story fits this category, but I highly recommend "Bits" and "Cat Pictures Please"
